# Lights Out

## Introduction

Lights out is a simple puzzle game. You are given a 5x5 grid of tiles; some
are lit up, some aren't. Clicking a tile will toggle that tile and the four
adjacent to it. Your goal is to turn off all of the lights.

## Instructions

Gameplay is simple. The lower right of the window will show the current status
of the grid. Press the New Game button to scramble the board and solve away.

In the Settings window, you will be given a set of options to choose from;
try different game modes, choose your preferences, and customize the colors
of the game board as you please. Settings will be saved for you.

In the Settings window you are also given the ability to save or load a game
save. Game saves will be in the .los format.
